1. **Networking Setup:**
   - Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
   - Create two subnets within the VPC: one public subnet and one private subnet.
   - Configure route tables so that the public subnet has access to the internet via an Internet Gateway, while the private subnet routes traffic through a NAT Gateway or NAT instance for internet access.

2. **Compute Setup:**
   - Launch EC2 instances for your WordPress application. One instance will be in the public subnet to host the web server accessible from the internet, and the other instance will be in the private subnet to host the database server.

3. **Object Storage:**
   - Utilize Amazon S3 for storing media files uploaded to WordPress. Configure the necessary permissions to access these files from your WordPress website.

4. **Database Setup:**
   - Use Amazon RDS to host your WordPress database. Choose the appropriate database engine (e.g., MySQL, MariaDB) and configure the instance to be located in the private subnet for security.

5. **Security:**
   - Implement security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic for your EC2 instances and RDS database.
   - Configure Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) to control traffic at the subnet level.
   - Use IAM roles for EC2 instances to provide necessary permissions for accessing other AWS services securely.

6. **Load Balancing (Optional):**
   - If needed, set up an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in front of your EC2 instances for better scalability and availability.

7. **Domain Name System (DNS):**
   - Set up a DNS record to point to your WordPress application. You can use Amazon Route 53 or any other DNS service for this purpose.

8. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Enable CloudWatch Logs for monitoring logs from your EC2 instances and RDS database.
   - Set up CloudWatch Alarms to notify you of any resource issues or performance bottlenecks.

9. **Backup and Disaster Recovery:**
   - Configure automated backups for your RDS instance to ensure data durability and enable point-in-time recovery.
   - Implement snapshot backups for your EC2 instances and store them in Amazon S3 for disaster recovery purposes.

10. **Scaling:**
    - Utilize AWS Auto Scaling to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on traffic patterns to your WordPress site.
